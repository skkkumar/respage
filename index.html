<h3>Post processing comparison</h3>
<br>
We can observe that due to the post processing step there is a performance raise. 
Post processing step is to discard the frames which has 80% of the keypoints to be detected as anomolies. In the output videos we can notice the frames with green plot of anomoly as discarded frames. The red and the pink can be considered to be included. As I showed in the <a href="earlier_page/index.html">ground truth page</a>, by including the stabilization data the result improved. But still, I included 10% of the whole data to be stabilization data and I am not sure how much percent is really necessary.

<h3>3 Different views</h3>
<br>

<br>
Below 2 experiments are done in 3 different views. The sample of 3 different views are shown below. where the room is the same room but the robot is looking at a different part of the room.

<h3>Learning in different view and Testing in different view</h3>
<br>
In the below image it is a single roc graph for this section and the next section together. For this section you can look at legends with view1, view2, and view3 alone.

<br>
Each of the model is trained in different views and tested in the same view. The reason of doing this test is to see if the scene depth affect the algorithm 
<br>
<br>
More detailed observation is given in the respective pages.

<h3>Learning 3 different view as one model and testing in different view</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the above image it is a single roc graph for this section and the previous section together. For this section you can look at legends with 3model_view1, 3model_view2, and 3model_view3 alone.

<br>
The algorithm is trained with all three views and tested on each of the views. 
<br>
<br>
More detailed observation is given in the respective pages.

<h3>Training and Testing with different dimensional input velocity vector</h3>
<br>
This is observed in View 1. Where the same input data is being changed with different dimensions. 6D, 9D and 12D and I can observe there isnt much of improvement or change in the performance.
